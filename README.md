# Tree-of-Savior-Experience-Viewer-Lua-Mod

1. Extract the zip file.

2. Copy expviewer.lua to your TOS_ROOT directory (the one that has the release/patch/data folders). This is one directory above the one that has Client_tos.exe.

3. Copy dummy.ipf to the TOS_ROOT\data\ directory.

4. Copy expviewer.ipf to clipboard and navigate to TOS_ROOT\data. Don't paste it yet.

5. Launch the ToS patcher.

6. Watch dummy.ipf in your TOS_ROOT\data\ directory. As soon as you see it deleted, paste expviewer.ipf immediately. I believe you have to paste it before the patcher says 100% but after it deletes dummy.ipf. You have about a 1-2 second window. It's not that hard.

7. Load the game as usual. You should see the expviewer frame when your character loads.

8. Press "Start" on

You will have to do steps 3-7 every time you launch the game until me or someone can come up with a better way.

You don't have to use dummy.ipf. You can wait for it to delete expviewer.ipf from a previous run or just wing it. It's just a method to make it easier for the first time.

Small "R" button resets your session data.
