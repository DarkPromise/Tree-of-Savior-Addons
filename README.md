# Disclaimer

**Use at your own risk! I have no idea if you could get banned for this. There is nothing in their TOS from what I can tell that says mods like this are not allowed. I do not see why you would and it is not really detectable unless they go out of their way to add code to the client to detect it. If getting your account banned would upset you greatly, do not bother taking the risk. It is your choice if you use this or not.**

# Download

[Get the latest release here](https://github.com/Excrulon/Tree-of-Savior-Experience-Viewer-Lua-Mod/releases)

# Installation

0. You may want to backup the existing SumAni.ipf in TOS_ROOT\data. If you do, copy it to some place outside your TOS_ROOT directory as the game may delete it.

1. Extract the zip to your TOS_ROOT directory. expviewer.lua should be in TOS_ROOT and SumAni.ipf should be in TOS_ROOT\data.

2. Start game and login to character.

3. Press Start.

4. Play!

# Uninstall

Delete TOS_ROOT\expviewer.lua and TOS_ROOT\data\SumAni.ipf. I believe the patcher will redownload SumAni.ipf. If it doesn't, replace it with your backup.

# Usage

Small "R" button resets your session data.

Pressing Reset or killing a mob will save your window. It will also save the frame's location for your current session.
